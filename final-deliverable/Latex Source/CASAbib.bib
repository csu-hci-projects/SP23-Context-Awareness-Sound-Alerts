abstract = {Smartphones are considered to be "always on, always connected" but mobile users are not always attentive and responsive to incoming communication. We present a mixed methods study investigating how mobile users use ringer modes for managing interruption by and awareness of incoming communication, and how these practices and locales affect their attentiveness and responsiveness. We show that mobile users have diverse ringer mode usage, but they switch ringer modes mainly for three purposes: avoiding interruption, preventing the phone from disrupting the environment, and noticing important notifications. In addition, without signals of notifications, users are less likely to immediately attend to notifications, but they are not less responsive to those they have attended. Finally, ringer mode switches, attentiveness, and responsiveness are all correlated with certain locales. We discuss implications from these findings, and suggest how future CMC tools and notification services take different purposes for using ringer modes and locales into consideration.},

abstract = {People can generate mental representations of one physical magnitude (e.g., distance) in terms of another (e.g., pitch). Capitalizing on this ability, we developed a system that could help visually impaired people navigate by presenting them with sounds of lower or higher pitch according to their distance from objects that they gaze at. Eight blind-folded participants completed a Hebb-Williams Maze with the system and twelve blind-folded participants completed the maze without it. Both groups completed the maze five times. We found that participants completed the maze faster in the last three trials compared to the first trial. There were no differences between the groups in the pace of improvement and in the time to complete the maze. However, participants who used the system made less errors in the maze than participants who did not use it. Our findings indicate that the system can potentially assist visually impaired people navigate. The contribution of the system to navigation will be further investigated with larger number of participants and with more extensive training.},

In this paper we present an in-situ study of mobile interruptibility focusing on the effect of cognitive and physical factors on the response time and the disruption perceived from a notification. Through a mixed method of automated smartphone logging and experience sampling we collected 10372 in-the-wild notifications and 474 questionnaire responses on notification perception from 20 users. We found that the response time and the perceived disruption from a notification can be influenced by its presentation, alert type, sender-recipient relationship as well as the type, completion level and complexity of the task in which the user is engaged. We found that even a notification that contains important or useful content can cause disruption. Finally, we observe the substantial role of the psychological traits of the individuals on the response time and the disruption perceived from a notification.},

In this paper we present a study of mobile user interruptibility with respect to notification content, its sender, and the context in which a notification is received. In a real-world study we collect around 70,000 instances of notifications from 35 users. We group notifications according to the applications that initiated them, and the social relationship between the sender and the receiver. Then, by considering both content and context information, such as the current activity of a user, we discuss the design of classifiers for learning the most opportune moment for the delivery of a notification carrying a specific type of information. Our results show that such classifiers lead to a more accurate prediction of users' interruptibility than an alternative approach based on user-defined rules of their own interruptibility.},

The results showed that disruption in the primary task was the same regardless of the notification modality. It was also found that differences in notification effectiveness were due to the inherent traits of a modality, e.g.olfactory notifications were slowest to deliver. The results of this experiment allow researchers and developers to capitalize on the different properties of multimodal techniques, with significant implications for home care technology and technology targeted at users with sensory impairments.},

While they find a large number of actual defects, they are often plagued by high rates of alerts that a developer would not act on (unactionable alerts) because they are incorrect, do not significantly affect program execution, etc. High rates of unactionable alerts decrease the utility of static analysis tools in practice. We present a method for differentiating actionable and unactionable alerts by finding alerts with similar code patterns. To do so, we create a feature vector based on code characteristics at the site of each SA alert. With these feature vectors, we use machine learning techniques to build an actionable alert prediction model that is able to classify new SA alerts. We evaluate our technique on three subject programs using the FindBugs static analysis tool and the Faultbench benchmark methodology. For a developer inspecting the top 5\% of all alerts for three sample projects, our approach is able to identify 57 of 211 actionable alerts, which is 38 more than the FindBugs priority measure. Combined with previous actionable alert identification techniques, our method finds 75 actionable alerts in the top 5\%, which is four more actionable alerts (a 6\% improvement) than previous actionable alert identification techniques.},

Unfortunately the awareness can come with the price of disruption to the focal task. We review results of a field study on the use and perceived value of email notifications in the workplace. We recorded users' interactions with software applications for two weeks and studied how notifications or their forced absence influenced users' quest for awareness of new email arrival, as well as the impact of notifications on their overall task focus. Results showed that users view notifications as a mechanism to provide passive awareness rather than a trigger to switch tasks. Turing off notifications cause some users to self interrupt more to explicitly monitor email arrival, while others appear to be able to better focus on their tasks. Users acknowledge notifications as disruptive, yet opt for them because of their perceived value in providing awareness.},

Additionally, a white noise sound was triggered in a third of the trials. The primary task was to react to visual stimuli placed on a screen in front.

    abstract = {It is hoped that context-aware systems will present users with an increasing number of relevant services in an increasingly wide range of contexts. With this expansion, numerous service notifications could overwhelm users. Therefore, careful design of the notification mechanism is needed. In this paper, we investigate how semantic richness of different types of audio stimuli can be utilised to shape the intuitiveness of mobile service notifications. In order to do so, we first develop a categorisation of mobile services so that clustered services can share the same notifications. Not surprisingly, it was found that overall speech performed better than non-speech sounds, and auditory icons performed overall better than earcons. However, exceptions were observed when richer semantics were utilised in the seemingly poorer medium. We argue that success and subjective preference of auditory mobile service notifications heavily depends on the success and level of directness of the metaphors used.},

Prior work has examined interventions, such as deferring notification delivery to opportune moments, but has not systematically studied how users might prefer an intelligent system to manage their notifications. Hence, we directly probed Android smartphone users’ notification preferences via a one-week experience-sampling study (N = 35). We found that users prefer mitigating undesired interruptions by suppressing alerts over deferring them and referred to notification content factors more frequently than contextual factors for explaining their preferences. Then we demonstrated the challenges and potentials of leveraging user actions to help predict notification preferences. Specifically, we showed that a model personalized using user actions achieved a performance gain of 39% than a generic model. This improvement is similar to the 42% performance gain using labels solicited from the user while using observable user actions causes no extra disruption.},

    abstract = {Inopportune driver notifications are a real problem that may cause distractions and interruptions in traffic, and hence accidents. Notifications on mobile devices are one of the ways by which drivers are interrupted, reaching extremely high amounts in a normal day. Despite that, notifications are valued by users and they are part of the common use of smartphones. Therefore, how to lessen the interruptive potential of notifications without eliminating them completely? To mitigate this problem, the present work proposes a context-aware notification system with the identification of opportune and inopportune moments for drivers notification. The proposed system uses smartphone sensors (gyroscope and GPS) to infer if the driver may be interrupted in a specific moment to receive a notification. Preliminary experiments were performed with people in real driving situations to verify if the system could identify opportune and inopportune moments, and found results indicate that is possible to identify these moments with a general accuracy of 88%.},

    abstract = {Notifications on smartphones are ubiquitous; they are providing a broad range of information, from rather technical (e.g. app updates) to interpersonal (e.g. a message from a friend). The disruptive nature poses the challenge of finding opportune moments for delivery of notifications, and receptivity to notifications depends on various factors that include perceived urgency and time of delivery. This paper presents a case study with 126 000 participants investigating the effect of the factor time on receptivity to notifications on smartphones in the context of an advertising service. Results show significant differences for weekdays and time of day regarding response times and number of notification-triggered application launches. We conclude with a discussion on the key findings and propose design implications for push notification campaigns.},

In addition, dynamic aspects of living with disability, life transitions, including ageing, psychological distress, long-term conditions such as chronic pain and new conditions such as long-COVID further affect people's abilities. Interactions with this diversity of embodiments can be enriched, empowered and augmented through using multisensory and cross-sensory modalities to create more inclusive technologies and experiences. To explore this, in this workshop we will explore three related sub-domains: immersive multi-sensory experiences, embodied experiences, and disability interactions and design. The aim is to better understand how we can re-think the senses in technology design for disability interactions and the dynamic self, constructed through continuously changing sensing capabilities either because of changing ability or because of the empowering technology. This workshop will: (i) bring together HCI researchers from different areas, (ii) discuss tools, frameworks and methods, and (iii) form a multidisciplinary community to build synergies for further collaboration.},

However, little is understood about the nature and effect of such notifications on the daily lives of mobile users. We report from a one-week, in-situ study involving 15 mobile phones users, where we collected real-world notifications through a smartphone logging application alongside subjective perceptions of those notifications through an online diary. We found that our participants had to deal with 63.5 notifications on average per day, mostly from messengers and email. Whether the phone is in silent mode or not, notifications were typically viewed within minutes. Social pressure in personal communication was amongst the main reasons given. While an increasing number of notifications was associated with an increase in negative emotions, receiving more messages and social network updates also made our participants feel more connected with others. Our findings imply that avoiding interruptions from notifications may be viable for professional communication, while in personal communication, approaches should focus on managing expectations.},

It uses pieces of music which are composed in such a way, that particular instruments or motifs can be added or omitted without losing the aesthetic quality of the overall composition. This allows for very subtle modifications in the soundscape which are only noticed by those users who have chosen this particular instrument or motif as "their" notification instrument before. As a side effect, the soundscape itself can be used to subtly influence the mood of users. The method has been implemented in a prototype, which we briefly discuss. The prototype is implemented using a spatial audio framework and can hence notify users from particular directions.},

The system uses statistical models to realize defer-to-breakpoint policies for managing notifications. The first study tested how well the models detect three types of breakpoints within novel task sequences. Results show that the models detect breakpoints reasonably well, but struggle to differentiate their type. Our second study explored effects of managing notifications with our system on users and their tasks. Results showed that scheduling notifications at breakpoints reduces frustration and reaction time relative to delivering them immediately. We also found that the relevance of notification content determines the type of breakpoint at which it should be delivered. The core concept of scheduling notifications at breakpoints fits well with how users prefer notifications to be managed. This indicates that users would likely adopt the use of notification management systems in practice.},

There is a problem in telecommunication due to the Lombard effect. A speaker talks at a louder volume than necessary for the conversation partner at a remote location. This paper proposes a volume model that is required in order to automatically adjust the volume of an operator's voice at a remote communication via a telepresence robot, and develops an optimal volume control system LombaBot equipped on a telepresence robot with the model. The volume model measures the level of noise around the robot and the distance between a conversation partner and the robot to adjust the volume of the operator's voice. It has two types of volume adjustments. Those are called comfortable volume and secret talk volume. LombaBot enables people at a remote site to listen comfortably to the voice of a robot operator. Moreover, the operator is able to talk in low voices when s/he wants to talk in secret with nearby people. We confirmed that LombaBot adjusted the volume of an operator's voice properly in the noisy remote location.},

The term audio film was coined by the authors as part of the research project entitled 'The Design of an Audio Film for the Visually Impaired'.The term was chosen for two main reasons: firstly, because the final work is to be experienced in a cinema environment, and secondly, because certain elements of the filmmaking process might be adapted for the conveyance of a story through sound, creating an experience equivalent to the cinematic experience.The present paper explores the possibility of minimising or eliminating speech in audio films. In particular it focuses on the comparison of two versions of an extract from The Sound Machine by Roald Dahl (1949). The first version portrays the story through the use of sound effects, internal sounds and music, while the second, is identical to the first but with the addition of speech.},

We derive a holistic picture of notifications on mobile phones by collecting close to 200 million notifications from more than 40,000 users. Using a data-driven approach, we break down what users like and dislike about notifications. Our results reveal differences in importance of notifications and how users value notifications from messaging apps as well as notifications that include information about people and events.
